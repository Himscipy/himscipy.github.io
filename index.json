We introduce a machine learning framework for the acceleration of RANS to predict steady-state turbulent eddy viscosities, given the initial conditions. This surrogate model for the turbulent eddy viscosity is assessed for parametric interpolation, while numerically solving for the pressure and velocity equations to steady-state, thus representing a framework that is hybridized with machine learning. We achieve accurate steady-state results with a significant reduction in solution time when compared to those obtained by the Spalart-Allmaras one-equation model. Most notably the proposed methodology allows for considerably larger relaxation factors for the steady-state velocity and pressure solvers. Our assessments are made for a backward-facing step with considerable mesh anisotropy and separation to represent a practical CFD application. For test experiments with varying inlet velocity conditions, we see time-to-solution reductions around a factor of 5. Similar results are obtained for a surrogate modeling strategy that generalizes across varying step heights. The proposed framework represents an excellent opportunity for the rapid exploration of large parameter spaces that prove prohibitive when utilizing turbulence closure models with multiple coupled partial differential equations.\n","date":1589932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589932800,"objectID":"59994eb67f3447f7fb4702e4121a487c","permalink":"https://himscipy.github.io/project/my-project-tensorflowmachinelearning/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/my-project-tensorflowmachinelearning/","section":"project","summary":"The work aims to demonstrate capabilities doing in-situ co-simulations strategies of Machine Learning and Computational Fluid Dynamics Solver (OpenFOAM) ","tags":["Machine Learning","Computational Fluid Dynamics","Data-Driven Modeling"],"title":"Integrating Deep Learning with Computational Fluid Dynamics Solvers","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581969646,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581969646,"objectID":"2a4c1e02cf6480428e85303ba34d71e3","permalink":"https://himscipy.github.io/talk/my-talk-utrc2020/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T18:14:46-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/my-talk-utrc2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Residential and commercial buildings account for 41% of total energy consumption in the United States.

These are used for accessing and ensuring indoor air quality, and also for ensuring safety in the event of chemical and biological attacks. It follows that optimal placement of sensors become important to accurately monitor contaminant levels in the indoor environment. However, contaminant transport inside the indoor environment is governed by the indoor flow conditions which are affected by various uncertainties associated with the building systems including occupancy and boundary fluxes. Therefore, it is important to account for all associated uncertainties while designing the sensor layout.The transfer operator based framework provides an effective way to identify optimal placement of sensors. Previous work has been limited to sensor placements under deterministic scenarios. In this work we extend the transfer operator based approach for optimal sensor placement while accounting for building systems uncertainties. The methodology provides a probabilistic metric to gauge coverage under uncertain conditions. We illustrate the capabilities of the framework with examples exhibiting boundary flux uncertainty.\n","date":1557715056,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557715056,"objectID":"141dfd1420f78842e7b60283d7175244","permalink":"https://himscipy.github.io/project/my-project-sensorplace/","publishdate":"2019-05-12T19:37:36-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/my-project-sensorplace/","section":"project","summary":"The sensor placement algorithm accounting for building airflow uncertainty based on Perron-Frobenius Operator.","tags":["Building Systems","Indoor Air Quality","Uncertainty Quantification","Energy Simulation Tools"],"title":"Indoor Air Quality Sensor Placement Accounting for Airflow Uncertainty ","type":"project"},{"authors":["S.
